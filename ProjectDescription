PROJECT- Octal Full-Adder

Input: A, B = octal digits (see representation below); Cin-binary digit Output: S = octal digit (see representation below); 
Cout-binary digit

Task: U
sing only_binary_FAs to perform the actual addition, design a circuit that performs as an octal FA. 
More specifically, this circuit would input the two octal digits A, B, convert them into binary numbers, 
add them using three binary FAs, convert the binary result back to octal, 
and output the sum as an octal digit, and the binary carry out.
